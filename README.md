# Å kolska praksa materials

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks (specifically Polyglot for C# and .NET) presented in a slideshow format with RISE.

These slides were prepared for the "Teacher internship" subject at my university.
I've used them for an interactive lecture at my former high-school, which was the main part of that exam.
