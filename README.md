# Å kolska praksa materials

These are the materials were prepared for the "Teacher internship" subject at my university.
I've used them for an interactive lecture at my former high-school, which was the main part of that exam.

Tech used:
1. Jupyter Notebooks (specifically Polyglot for C# and .NET)
2. RISE for converting the notebook to interactive slides

Also, there  are solo C# files, used for demonstrating the usage of the console to compile and run `.cs` files.
